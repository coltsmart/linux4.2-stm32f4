* StMicro STM32 Direct Memory Access Controller (DMA)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,<chip>-dma".
- reg: Should contain DMA registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain DMA interrupt.
- #dma-cells: Must be <2>, used to represent the number of integer cells in
the dmas property of client devices.

Example:

dma2: dma@40026400 {
	compatible = "st,stm32f4-dma";
	#dma-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0x40026400 0x400>;
	interrupts = <56 57 58 59 60 68 69 70>;
	clocks = <&rcc 0 22>;
};

DMA clients connected to the STM32 DMA controller must use the format
described in the dma.txt file, using a three-cell specifier for each channel:
a phandle plus two integer cells, which specify the peripheral.
The three cells in order are:

1. A phandle pointing to the DMA controller.
2. The DMA stream
3. The DMA channel

Example:

usart1: serial@40011000 {
	compatible = "st,stm32-usart";
	reg = <0x40011000 0x400>;
	interrupts = <37>;
	st,use-dma-rx;
	st,use-dma-tx;
	dmas = <&dma2 5 4>, <&dma2 7 4>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
};
