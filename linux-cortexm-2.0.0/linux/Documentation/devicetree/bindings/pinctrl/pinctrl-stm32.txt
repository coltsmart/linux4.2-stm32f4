* STM32 GPIO and Pin Mux/Config controller

STMicroelectronics's STM32 MCUs intregrate a GPIO and Pin mux/config hardware
controller. It controls the input/output settings on the available pins and
also provides ability to multiplex and configure the output of various on-chip
controllers onto these pads.

Pin controller node:
Required properies:
- compatible	: "st,stm32-pinctrl"
- #address-cells: The value of this property must be 1
- #size-cells	: The value of this property must be 1
- ranges	: defines mapping between pin controller node (parent) to
  gpio-bank node (children).

GPIO controller/bank node:
Required properties:
- gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller
- #gpio-cells	  : Should be two.
			The first cell is the pin number
			The second one is the polarity:
				- 0 for active high
				- 1 for active low
- reg		  : The gpio address range, relative to the pinctrl range
- st,bank-name	  : Should be a name string for this bank as specified in
  the datasheet

Optional properties:
- reset:	  : Reference to the reset controller

Example:
#include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-stm32.h>
...

	pin-controller {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "st,stm32-pinctrl";
		ranges = <0 0x40020000 0x3000>;

		gpioa: gpio@40020000 {
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
			reg = <0x0 0x400>;
			resets = <&reset_ahb1 0>;
			st,bank-name = "GPIOA";
		};
		...
		pin-functions nodes follow...
	};

Contents of function subnode node:
----------------------------------

Required properties for pin configuration node:
- st,pins	: Child node with list of pins with configuration.

Below is the format of how each pin conf should look like.

<bank offset altmode pull type speed>

Every PIO is represented with 4 to 6 parameters.
Each parameter is explained as below.

- bank	  : Should be bank phandle to which this PIO belongs.
- offset  : Offset in the PIO bank.
- altmode : Should be mode or alternate function number associated this pin, as
described in the datasheet (IN, OUT, ALT0...ALT15, ANALOG)
- pull	  : Should be either NO_PULL, PULL_UP or PULL_DOWN
- type	  : Should be either PUSH_PULL or OPEN_DRAIN.
	    Setting it is not needed for IN and ANALOG modes, or alternate
	    functions acting as inputs.
- speed	  : Value taken from the datasheet, depending on the function
(LOW_SPEED, MEDIUM_SPEED, FAST_SPEED, HIGH_SPEED)
	    Setting it is not needed for IN and ANALOG modes, or alternate
	    functions acting as inputs.

usart1 {
	pinctrl_usart1: usart1-0 {
		st,pins {
			tx = <&gpioa 9 ALT7 NO_PULL PUSH_PULL LOW_SPEED>;
			rx = <&gpioa 10 ALT7 NO_PULL PUSH_PULL LOW_SPEED>;
		};
	};
};

adc2 {
	pinctrl_adc2: adc2-0 {
		st,pins {
			adc0 = <&gpioe 4 ANALOG NO_PULL>;
		};
	};
};

usart1: usart@40011000 {
	...
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_usart1>;
};
