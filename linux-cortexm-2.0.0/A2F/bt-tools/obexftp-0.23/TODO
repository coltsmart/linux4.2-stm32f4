ObexFTP to do list
==================

* verify memory alloc's with bindings

* cancel (async?) support for bindings

* obexftp.is_connected() perhaps?

* get perl and ruby to uninstall for distcheck (only python and tcl distcheck clean)

* put to specified file (-p file.vcf -f telecom/pb.vcf)

* Discover port and protocol to use (i.e. Bt, IrDA, TTY)
